\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Sample collection}

\textit{F. rufa}, nest material (pine needles and resin) and soil within 1m radius of a nest were collected in September 2020 from Harlestone Firs, a forested area of predominantly fir trees (Harlestone Road, New Duston, Northampton, UK; GPS coordinates: 52.267750, -0.955719). Samples were collected by depositing ants, nest material and soil separately into clean zip-loc plastic bags, sealed and stored at -20$^{\circ}$C until further use. 

\subsection*{Isolation and sequencing of bacteria}
Preparation of samples for isolation took place using aseptic technique. Samples were placed into 1ml Eppendorph tubes and crushed using a pestle into 10$\mu$L or 100$\mu$L PBS and vortexed for 30s, and the liquid was transferred onto agar plates. A variety of media were used including nutrient agar, Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA), MRS and modified AE medium (8g/L yeast extract, 15g/L peptone, 10g/L D-glucose, 5mL/L ethanol (99.8\%), 3mL/L acetic acid, final pH 3.5). Plates were supplemented with 0.1g/L cycloheximide to inhibit growth of fungi, and incubated for 7 days at\SI{30}{\celsius} either in aerobic conditions or in semi-anaerobic Candlewick jars. Colonies with distinct morphologies were re-streaked onto fresh agar plates and colony PCR performed. Single colonies were picked with a sterile pipette tip which was used as template by dipping into 50 $\mu$ L 1x PCR master mix (DreamTaq Green PCR Master Mix; ThermoFisher) with primers 27F (5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3') and 530R (5'-CCGCNGCNGCTGGCAC-3') or 1492R (5'-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3'). The primer pair 27F-530R amplify a ~500bp region of the 16S rRNA gene spanning hypervariable regions V1 to V3, whereas 27F-1492R amplify a ~1500bp region spanning the entire 16S rRNA gene from V1 to V9. PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of \SI{95}{\celsius} for 15 min; 35 cycles of: \SI{95}{\celsius} for 30s, \SI{55}{\celsius}, \SI{72}{\celsius} for 2 minutes; 1 cycle of \SI{72}{\celsius} for 5 minutes; pause at \SI{4}{\celsius}. 5ÂµL from each PCR reaction was run on a 1\% agarose gel at 80V for 60 mins to determine whether a band was present at ~500bp. Where a single band of ~500bp was obtained and where the corresponding no-template control did not produce any bands, PCR reactions were purified using the [insert kit] kit. Purified DNA was quantified using Qbit HS DNA Assay kit and sent for Sanger Sequencing with GATC. Single colonies from re-streaked plates were inoculated into liquid media and grown to an OD of 0.8-1.2, from which glycerol stocks were made for long-term storage, with a final concentration of 30\% glycerol. To extract genomic DNA, glycerol stocks were used to create fresh streak-plates from which colonies were picked and used to inoculate 12.5 mL liquid media in a 50 mL falcon tube and grown at \SI{30}{\celsius} for 24h. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen Blood and Tissue Kit, with the enzymatic lysis pre-treatment step included. DNA was quantified using Qbit HS DNA Assay and stored at -\SI{20}\celsius. Purified genomic DNA was sent to MiGS (Pittsburgh, USA) for whole genome sequencing. 

\subsection*{Predicting prophages in genomes}
Whole genome sequences of bacteria were input into PHASTER \citep{arndt_phaster:_2016} to predict prophages. 

\subsection*{Optimising bacterial growth}
To determine required growth conditions, growth curves were produced for each isolate by inoculating an overnight culture into a 96 well micro-plate containing sterile media. Growth was monitored using a Varioskan machine, by measuring changes in OD every 30 minutes over 48h. 

From \citep{rubin_dietary_2019}:
The PMAnalyzer pipeline was used to analyze the growth curves. The PMAnalyzer pipeline receives OD files from the microtiter plate reader as an input and uses the SciPy Python numerical library to model each growth curve. Each growth curve was fitted with the Zwietering model to predict the y0 (OD600 nm where growth begins), lag time, maximum growth rate, and biomass yield. 
Differences between growth curves were analyzed by comparing experimental wells to controls using a method similar to one developed by Firsov who determined that the antimicrobial effect of any compound could be measured by directly comparing the growth of cells when the compound is present or absent. Some compounds were excluded from the heatmap analysis because they formed precipitates in the wells or were too opaque to accurately measure OD600 nm. Although these compounds could not be used for growth curve analyses, they were suitable for flow cytometry.

\subsection*{Antimicrobial effect of formic acid}
The effect of \textit{F. rufa} venom on bacterial growth was investigated using artificial venom composed of [insert venom composition]. [insert venom composition refs]

\begin{itemize}
    \item Note: Natural venom will be collected from ants by sampling workers from nests in the field and placing small groups of workers into eppendorph tubes. Tubes containing workers will be taken back to the laboratory and left undisturbed at room temperature for 4 hours so that ants can replenish their venom vesicles. Tubes containing ants will shaken to encourage ants to release their venom, after which they will be anaesthetised by placing tubes at -\SI{20}{\celsius} for 20 minutes. Tubes will be left at room temperature for 5 minutes and centrifuged at [insert speed] to collect venom, which will be pippetted from the base of the tube.  
    
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Prophage induction - planned work}
Methods from \citep{rubin_dietary_2019}. Bacteria were cultured in the presence of each of the test compounds for 24 h in 96-well plates. A single colony from each isolate was used to inoculate a 3 mL liquid overnight culture, and 140 Î¼L of diluted overnight culture (1:10 in media) was then mixed with 10 Î¼L of test compound solution. For isolates requiring anaerobic conditions, volumes were doubled and 96-well plates sealed with film to promote anaerobic conditions. The following controls were included: media alone (media control), bacteria in media without test compound (bacterial viability control), and each diluent used for the various test compounds. Using a Varioskan plate reader/incubator, optical density (OD) at 600 nm (OD600 nm) was measured every 10 min. Each test was accompanied by a positive âinductionâ control of carbadox (Sigma-Aldrich) at a range of final concentrations.

\subsection*{Nanocyte/phage induction}



\subsection*{Effect of bacteria on ant survival - Planned work}
Methods from \citet{chapuisat_wood_2007}.
We recorded the survival of adult workers or larvae when exposed to each bacterium, compared with a bacteria-free control. Single workers were kept in 5.5 cm diameter Petri dishes with a filter paper at the bottom. The ants were provided with ad libitum 8\% sugar water. Each control and treatment group had 20 replicates. 0.5 ml of peptone solution containing each bacterium at a concentration of \num{4e9} CFU ml\si{^-^1} was deposited in the centre of the filter paper, close to but not on the ant. The challenge-free controls received 0.5 ml of peptone solution. The entire filter paper became damp, so that the individuals probably came into direct contact with the micro-organisms, as infection is likely to occur through oral or cuticular contact.

The impact of potential pathogens on the survival of larvae was tested by placing three larvae in small artificial nests made of 9 cm circular plastic boxes with a filter paper covering the bottom of the nest and a central layer of plaster connected to a small underneath water reservoir (Passera et al. 1988). The nest was covered with a dark plastic flowerpot and placed in a 19Ã14 cm foraging arena lined with fluon to prevent escape. We provided sugar water and a protein-rich jelly made of honey, eggs and agar. Fifteen workers fed and tended the larvae. The design of these experiments was similar to that of the single adult workers, except the concentrations of micro-organisms (10\si{^1^1} CFUml\si{^-^1}), which was adapted to the larger box size and higher number of individuals. All experiments took place at \SI{25}{\celsius}. We recorded the survival of single adult workers and larvae on a daily basis, over 20 and 11 days, respectively, and removed corpses to prevent contamination. 

\section*{Results}
\subsection*{16S Colony PCR}
Isolates were identified using 16S Colony PCR prior to whole genome sequencing to ensure bacterial origin as some fungi are resistant to cyclohexamide.
